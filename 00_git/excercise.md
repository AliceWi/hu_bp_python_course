# Exercises - Version Control with git

1.	Clone this repository from: 
  Wait, you already did that! Well done!
  Pull from it, when we tell you to

2.	Follow this tutorial: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git
While doing it, please read the explanations and tips, and try to understand all of it. If any questions occur, or you're not sure about stuff, please ask! We'll try to answer or find out.

3.	Set up a git repository for the Guess-a-number game you programmed yesterday. Include the game in your first commit.
Make a remote repository (on github.com) and push your local repo to it.
Add a file named 'README.md', open that in an editor of your choice and shortly (!) write what your programm is doing. Commit again.
Make a new branch, add another file or change something (you could make your README more fancy by adding headings (howto is here: https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).
Commit and push! Is your new branch on github? Can you find the new README somewhere? Do you like it? Otherwise change and push some more!
Because your README turned out that well, merge your new branch into the master. Push.

4.	If there's still time left, find a partner. One of you will have to give write-access to the other one, so that you can both push to the same repository. (You can do that in Settings/Collaborators.)
Do you manage to to produce a merge-conflict (by both working on the same file, in the same repository)? 
Can you also solve it?
