# Exercises - Introduction to Python
SS 2015
HU Berlin


1. Play a round of `learn_python_light`!

    1. Start `IPython`
    2. Type `from learn_python_light import *` and follow the instructions
       (You should normally never use `from something import *`, because it messes with your namespace. But here and now: do it!)

2. GIT?!
    
    2. While writing the game from exercise 3, please commit it from time to time.
    3. Push your local commits to your remote repository.

3. Programm your own game: Guess a number!

    1. Create a file with the ending `.py`. You will write your code into this file.
    2. Write code, that generates a random number between 0 and 100 and asks the user for a guess of that number. If the first guess isn't right, it should give a hint and ask again. And so on.
    3. The programm should tell the user, how many times she/he had to guess.
    4. After a round of the game is finished, the user should be asked, if she/he wants to play again.

4. If there is still time left, please learn more git!

    1. Follow the tutorial https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git. Please read the explanations and tips.
